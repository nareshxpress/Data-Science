***in this assignment we analyzed house prices in Bengaluru using data visualization and statistical techniques. First, we cleaned the data by extracting BHK from the “size” column and calculating price per square foot. We studied distributions of total square feet and price using histograms and box plots. Then, we explored relationships between BHK, bathrooms, and price. A heatmap showed that total square feet strongly influence price. We identified some outliers in the data. Overall, this analysis helps in understanding real estate pricing trends and factors affecting house prices in Bengaluru***
